        <h3>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Addictive, savory noodles so easy you'll be regretting that you didn't make these sooner. Garlic, miso, and butter were a match made in heaven.
            Make a vat for meal prep and add mushrooms and protein throughout the week. I swear these noods don't get old.
